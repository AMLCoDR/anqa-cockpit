        ## Summary
        - Repository: ${{ github.repository }}
        - Branch: ${{ github.ref_name }}
        - Commit: ${{ github.sha }}
        - Scan Type: Cockpit System Security
        
        ## Security Checks Performed
        - ✅ NPM dependency vulnerability scan
        - ✅ Sensitive data exposure check
        - ✅ Database security review
        - ✅ API and WebSocket security analysis
        - ✅ File permissions audit
        - ✅ Cockpit-specific security validation
        
        ## Cockpit-Specific Security
        - File monitoring system security validated
        - WebSocket communication security checked
        - Command bridge system security reviewed
        - Milestone database access controls verified
        
        ## Recommendations
        - Use environment variables for all sensitive configuration
        - Implement proper authentication for production APIs
        - Secure WebSocket connections with proper origin validation
        - Regular dependency updates and security patches
        - Monitor file monitoring permissions in production
        
        ## Data Protection Status
        - GitHub Secrets configured for sensitive data
        - No hardcoded credentials in repository
        - Proper CORS and security headers implemented
        - Database connections secured with environment variables
        - File monitoring restricted to development directories
